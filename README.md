# Description 

This guide is for configuring your Windows machine to train Tensorflow saved models. Guide assumes that source image files are annotated with Cloud Annotations tool (https://github.com/cloud-annotations/cloud-annotations) or are converted into Cloud annotations format.

Cloud Annotations tool is not hosted anymore, so you need to setup your own Cloud annotations using instructions from its Github repository. Another way at the moment is to annotate using another tool that supports Pascal VOC format and convert annotations to Cloud Annotations format using a convert script.

Converter scripts can be found from repository:

https://github.com/Lapland-UAS-Tequ/Object-Detection-Tools

Colab notebook https://colab.research.google.com/github/cloud-annotations/google-colab-training/blob/master/object_detection.ipynb has been used as template for this pipeline and functionality of this notebook has been transferred to work offline on Windows machine.

# Requirements

- Windows OS (Windows 10 & Windows 2019 server are tested)
- NVIDIA GPU (Quadro P600 and Tesla P100 are tested)

# Configuration

## 1. Download and install following software.

| Software      | Version       | Link |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-------------:| 
| CUDA          | 11.6.0_511.23 | https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads |
| cuDNN         | 8.3.2.44      | https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn |
| Protoc        | 3.19.4        | https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads |
| Python        | 3.10.2        | https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/ |
| Git           | 2.35.1        | https://git-scm.com/downloads |
| GPU drivers   | Supported driver for Cuda 11 | https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us |


CUDA & cuDNN installation steps are documented in following repository:

https://github.com/Lapland-UAS-Tequ/win10-nodered-tensorflow


## 2. Open command line and clone this project 

```
cd\
```

```
git clone https://github.com/Lapland-UAS-Tequ/tequ-tf2-ca-training-pipeline.git
```

## 3. Run batch-files to setup environment

```
cd c:\tequ-tf2-ca-training-pipeline
```


```
1. Install Python libraries.cmd
```

```
2. Clone models repository.cmd
```

```
3. Build object detection api.cmd
```

```
4. Setup environment variables.cmd
```

```
5. Run protoc.cmd
```

## 4. Get source files

- Export your Cloud Annotations project as ZIP-file
- Unzip files to C:\tequ-tf2-ca-training-pipeline\content\ca_source_data


# Training the model

```
cd c:\tequ-tf2-ca-training-pipeline
```

```
Run training process.cmd
```

Input requested values during process (base model, batch size, training steps)

Base model options: 1 or 2

Batch size depends of your GPU, I have used batch size = 12

For trraining steps I have used 10000

-Trained Tensorflow saved models will appear to: 

```C:\tequ-tf2-ca-training-pipeline\content\trained_models```


# Monitoring the model training process

Open new command line window

```
cd c:\tequ-tf2-ca-training-pipeline
```

```
Start TensorBoard.cmd
```

# Evaluating the model

Open command line 

```
cd c:\tequ-tf2-ca-training-pipeline
```

```
Evaluate model.cmd
```

*Evaluate model script assumes that you start it in same day after training. If you wish to run evaluate later, you need to modify the script*

# Using the model

Model files can be loaded and executed for example in Node-RED.
